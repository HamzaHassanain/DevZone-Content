## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer languages, such as SQL, Java, Python, and C++.

## Why Programming?

Programming is important because it enables us to instruct computers to perform tasks that are too complex or time-consuming for humans to do. Programming is also important because it allows us to automate repetitive tasks, which can save time and reduce errors.

## Programming Languages

A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used to create software programs, which are sets of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

#### Keep In Mind That:

- Programming languages are just tools that help us communicate with computers.
- There is No Best Programming Language.
- The Best Programming Language is the One that Suits Your Needs.
- There is No One-Size-Fits-All Programming Language.
- The Best Programming Language for You Depends on Your Goals and Interests.

#### Also, Keep In Mind That:

- Computers Only Do what You Tell Them to Do.
- If The Computer Does Something Wrong, It's Because You Told It to Do Something Wrong.
- Computers are Stupid, They Only Do What You Tell Them to Do.
- Computers Only Understand Machine Code.

## Machine Code

Machine code is the lowest level of programming language. It is the language that computers understand. Machine code is a set of binary instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Machine code is difficult to read and write, so most programmers use higher-level programming languages to create software programs.

## Types of Programming Languages

Programming languages can be divided into two main categories: low-level programming languages and high-level programming languages.

### Low-Level Programming Languages

These languages are closer to machine code. They are difficult to read and write, and they are not portable between different types of computers. Examples of low-level programming languages include assembly language and machine code.

### High-Level Programming Languages

These languages are easier to read and write than low-level programming languages. They are portable between different types of computers, which means that a program written in a high-level programming language can run on any computer that has a compiler for that language. Examples of high-level programming languages include C++, Java, Python, and Ruby.

## Compilers and Interpreters

To make the code that you write understandable to the computer, you need to convert it into machine code. This process is done by a compiler or an interpreter.

### Compiler:

A compiler is a program that translates the code that you write into machine code before you run it. The compiler generates an executable fiLanguagesle that you can run on your computer. Examples of compiled languages include C++, Java, and C#.

### Interpreter:

An interpreter is a program that translates the code that you write into machine code as you run it. The interpreter does not generate an executable file. Instead, it reads the code line by line and executes it. Examples of interpreted languages include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.

## Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

### Compiled Languages

- Compile Once, Run Anywhere, But Slow to Compile.
- Faster Execution.
- Better Performance.
- Platform Dependent.
- Harder to Debug.
- Examples: C++, Java, C#.

### Interpreted Languages

- Write Once, Run Anywhere, But Slow to Execute.
- Slower Execution.
- Slow Performance, Because The Code is Interpreted Line by Line each Time it Runs.
- Platform Independent.
- Easier to Debug.

## Tools for Programming

There are many tools available to help you write, test, and debug your code. Some of the most common tools include:

### Text Editors

Text editors are programs that allow you to create and edit text files. Examples of text editors include Notepad, TextEdit, and Vim.

### Code Editors

Code editors are programs that are specifically designed for writing code. They often include features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools. Examples of code editors include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a program that combines a code editor with other tools, such as a compiler, debugger, and version control system. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.

### Version Control Systems

Version control systems are programs that help you keep track of changes to your code. They allow you to save different versions of your code, collaborate with other programmers, and revert to previous versions if needed. Examples of version control systems include Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

## Syntax

Syntax refers to the rules that govern how you write code in a programming language. Each programming language has its own syntax, which you must follow in order for the code to be understood by the computer. Syntax errors occur when you violate the rules of the programming language.

## Basic C++ Program Structure

A basic C++ program consists of the following parts:

- Preprocessor Directives
- Namespace Declaration
- Main Function
- Statements

```cpp

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

```

## Data Types

Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. C++ supports several data types, including:

### Primitive Data Types

- int: Integer values.
- long long: Long integer values.
- float: Floating-point values.
- double: Double-precision floating-point values.
- char: Single characters.
- bool: Boolean values.

### Non-Primitive Data Types

- Arrays: A collection of elements of the same type.
- Strings: A collection of characters.

## Variables

Variables are used to store data in a program. Each variable has a name, a type, and a value. Variables must be declared before they can be used.

### Variable Naming

- Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore.
- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Variable names should be descriptive.
- No Spaces or Special Characters.
- No Two Variables Can Have The Same Name.
- No Keywords.

### Variable Declaration

```cpp

int age;
long long id;
float weight;
double height;
char c;
bool isStudent;

string name;
int scores[5];
```

### Variable Initialization

```cpp

int age = 25;
long long id = 1234567890;
float weight = 65.5;
double height = 175.5;
char c = 'A';
bool isStudent = true;

string name = "John";
int scores[5] = {90, 85, 80, 75, 70};


age = 30;
weight = 70.5;
height = 180.5;
c = 'B';
isStudent = false;
scores[0] = 95;

scores = {95, 90, 85, 80, 75}; // Error: Array Assignment is Not Allowed.
```

### C++ Integer V.S Long Long

- int: 4 Bytes, -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- long long: 8 Bytes, -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

### C++ Floating-Point V.S Double

- float: 4 Bytes, 6 Decimal Digits.
- double: 8 Bytes, 15 Decimal Digits.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations in a program. C++ supports several arithmetic operators, including:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (\*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%): Returns the Remainder of a Division.

```cpp

int x = 10;
int y = 5;

int sum = x + y;
int difference = x - y;
int product = x * y;
int quotient = x / y;
int remainder = x % y;

```

- Addition With Two Strings: Concatenation.

```cpp

string firstName = "John";
string lastName = "Doe";

string fullName = firstName +  lastName; // JohnDoe

```

- Addition With Two Characters: ASCII Value.
  - What is the ASCII Value? - Each Character is Represented by a Number, Called an ASCII Value, that is Stored in 1 Byte (8 Bits), for example, the ASCII Value of 'A' is 65, and the ASCII Value of 'a' is 97, also, the ASCII Value of '0' is 48, now we say, the ASCII Value of 'B' is 'A' + 1 = 65 + 1 = 66, and so on, same for the Lowercase Letters, and the Digits (0-9).

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. C++ supports several assignment operators, including:

- Assignment (=)
- Addition Assignment (+=)
- Subtraction Assignment (-=)
- Multiplication Assignment (\*=)
- Division Assignment (/=)
- Modulus Assignment (%=)

```cpp

int x = 10;

x += 5; // x = x + 5 = 15
x -= 5; // x = x - 5 = 10
x *= 5; // x = x * 5 = 50
x /= 5; // x = x / 5 = 10
x %= 5; // x = x % 5 = 0

```

### Prefix and Postfix Increment and Decrement Operators

- Prefix Increment (++x): Increment x by 1, then Return x.
- Postfix Increment (x++): Return x, then Increment x by 1.
- Prefix Decrement (--x): Decrement x by 1, then Return x.
- Postfix Decrement (x--): Return x, then Decrement x by 1.

```cpp

int x = 10;
int y = ++x; // x = 11, y = 11
int z = x++; // x = 12, z = 11

int a = 10;
int b = --a; // a = 9, b = 9
int c = a--; // a = 8, c = 9

```

## Basic Input/Output

Input/Output (I/O) operations are used to read data from the user and display data to the user. C++ supports several I/O operations, including:

1- cin: Used to read data from the user.
2- cout: Used to display data to the user.

```cpp

int age;
float weight;
double height;
char c;
bool isStudent;

string name;

cout << "Enter Your Age: ";
cin >> age;

cout << "Enter Your Weight: ";
cin >> weight;

cout << "Enter Your Height: ";
cin >> height;

cout << "Enter a Character: ";
cin >> c;

cout << "Are You a Student? (1 for Yes, 0 for No): ";
cin >> isStudent;

cout << "Enter Your Name: ";
cin >> name;

```

## Comments

Comments are used to explain the code to other programmers or to remind yourself of what the code does. C++ supports two types of comments:

- Single-Line Comments: Begin with // and end at the end of the line.
- Multi-Line Comments: Begin with /_ and end with _/.

```cpp

// This is a Single-Line Comment.

/*
This is a Multi-Line Comment.
This is a Multi-Line Comment.
This is a Multi-Line Comment.
This is a Multi-Line Comment.
This is a Multi-Line Comment.

*/

```
