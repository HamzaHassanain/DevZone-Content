## What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Recursion is used to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Each recursive call works on a smaller subproblem until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops.

Recursion is a powerful and elegant technique that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, from simple mathematical calculations to complex data structures and algorithms.

## How Recursion Works

Recursion works by breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem recursively. Each recursive call works on a smaller subproblem until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops.

Here's a simple example of recursion in action:

```cpp

void countdown(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        cout << "Liftoff!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << n << endl;
        countdown(n - 1); // Recursive call
    }
}
```

In this example, the `countdown` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints the numbers from `n` down to `0`, followed by "Liftoff!". The base case is when `n` is `0`, at which point the recursion stops.

When the `countdown` function is called with an integer `n`, it prints the value of `n` and then calls itself with `n - 1`. This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops.

## Function Call Stack

Recursion uses a data structure called the function call stack to keep track of the state of each recursive call. Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created to store the function's local variables and parameters. When the function returns, the stack frame is removed, and control is passed back to the calling function.

The function call stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, which means that the most recent function call is the first to be removed when the function returns.

Here's an example of the function call stack in action:

```cpp

void foo(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        foo(n - 1); // Recursive call
    }
}
```

When the `foo` function is called with an integer `n`, a new stack frame is created to store the value of `n`. The `foo` function calls itself with `n - 1`, creating a new stack frame for the recursive call. This process continues until `n` is `0`, at which point the recursion stops and the stack frames are removed in reverse order.

## Recursion vs Iteration

Recursion and iteration are two common programming techniques used to solve problems. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem, while iteration is a technique where a loop is used to solve a problem.

Recursion is often more elegant and concise than iteration, but it can be less efficient in terms of memory usage and performance. Recursion can also be more difficult to understand and debug than iteration, especially for complex problems.

## Recursion Examples

### Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The factorial of `n` is denoted by `n!`.

The factorial of `n` can be calculated using recursion as follows:

```cpp

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1; // Base case
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
    }
}
```

### Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci series are `0` and `1`.

The Fibonacci series can be calculated using recursion as follows:

```cpp

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n; // Base case
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); // Recursive call
    }
}
```

### Binary Search

Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the array in half and comparing the target value with the middle element of the array.

Binary search can be implemented using recursion as follows:

```cpp


int binarySearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int target) {
    if (low > high) {
        return -1; // Base case
    }

    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

    if (arr[mid] == target) {
        return mid; // Target found
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
        return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, high, target); // Search right half
    } else {
        return binarySearch(arr, low, mid - 1, target); // Search left half
    }
}
```

In this example, the `binarySearch` function takes a sorted array `arr`, the lower and upper bounds of the array `low` and `high`, and a target value `target` as input. The function uses recursion to search for the target value within the array by dividing the array in half and comparing the target value with the middle element of the array.

If the target value is found, the function returns the position of the target value in the array. If the target value is not found, the function returns `-1`.
