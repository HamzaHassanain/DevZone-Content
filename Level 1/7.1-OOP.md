## What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several techniques to design and develop software in a modular and reusable way. OOP is based on the concept of "objects" that can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods or functions).

## Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but when it is instantiated (i.e., an object is created), memory is allocated.

```cpp

class Car {
    public:
        string brand;
        string model;
        int year;
};

Car myCar;



```

## Access Modifiers

Access modifiers are keywords that define the scope of the class members. There are three access modifiers in C++:

- `public`: Members are accessible from outside the class.
- `private`: Members are only accessible from within the class.
- `protected`: Members are accessible from within the class and its subclasses.

```cpp

class Car {
    public:
        string brand;
        string model;
        int year;
    private:
        int price;
};

Car myCar;

myCar.brand = "Ford"; // OK

myCar.price = 50000; // Error: 'int Car::price' is private within this context

```

## Constructors

A constructor is a special member function that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's data members. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

```cpp

class Car {
    public:
        string brand;
        string model;
        int year;
        Car(string brand, string model, int year) {
            this->brand = brand;
            this->model = model;
            this->year = year;
        }
};

Car myCar("Ford", "Mustang", 2021);

```

## Destructors

A destructor is a special member function that is called when an object is destroyed. It is used to clean up resources allocated by the object. Destructors have the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (`~`) and do not have any parameters or return type.

```cpp

class Car {
    public:
        string brand;
        string model;
        int year;
        Car(string brand, string model, int year) {
            this->brand = brand;
            this->model = model;
            this->year = year;
        }
        ~Car() {
            cout << "Car object destroyed" << endl;
        }
};

Car myCar("Ford", "Mustang", 2021);

```

## This Keyword

The `this` keyword is a pointer that refers to the current object. It is used to refer to the current object's members within the class.

## New and Delete

The `new` operator is used to dynamically allocate memory for an object on the heap. The `delete` operator is used to deallocate memory allocated by the `new` operator.

```cpp

Car* myCar = new Car("Ford", "Mustang", 2021);

delete myCar;

```

## Static Members

Static members are shared among all instances of a class. They are declared using the `static` keyword and can be accessed without creating an object of the class.

```cpp

class Car {
    public:
        static int count;
        Car() {
            count++;
        }
};

int Car::count = 0;

Car car1;

cout << Car::count << endl; // Output: 1

Car car2;

cout << Car::count << endl; // Output: 2

```

## Const Members

Const members are members that cannot be modified after initialization. They are declared using the `const` keyword.

```cpp

class Car {
    public:
        const string brand;
        const string model;
        const int year;
        Car(string brand, string model, int year) : brand(brand), model(model), year(year) {}
};

Car myCar("Ford", "Mustang", 2021);

myCar.brand = "Chevrolet"; // Error: assignment of read-only member 'Car::brand'

```

## Friend Functions

Friend functions are functions that are not members of a class but have access to its private and protected members. They are declared using the `friend` keyword.

```cpp

class Car {
    private:
        int price;
    public:
        Car(int price) : price(price) {}
        friend void displayPrice(Car car);
};

void displayPrice(Car car) {
    cout << "Price: " << car.price << endl;
}

Car myCar(50000);

displayPrice(myCar); // Output: Price: 50000

```

## Operator Overloading

Operator overloading is a feature that allows operators to be redefined for user-defined types. It enables the use of operators with user-defined types in the same way as built-in types.

```cpp

class Complex {
    private:
        double real;
        double imaginary;
    public:
        Complex(double real, double imaginary) : real(real), imaginary(imaginary) {}
        Complex operator+(const Complex& other) {
            return Complex(real + other.real, imaginary + other.imaginary);
        }
};

Complex a(1, 2);

Complex b(3, 4);

Complex c = a + b;

```

## Getters and Setters

Getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the private members of a class. They provide controlled access to the class members.

```cpp

class Car {
    private:
        int price;
    public:
        int getPrice() {
            return price;
        }
        void setPrice(int price) {
            this->price = price;
        }
};

Car myCar;

myCar.setPrice(50000);

cout << myCar.getPrice() << endl; // Output: 50000

```

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class inherits properties and behavior from an existing class. The existing class is called the base class or parent class, and the new class is called the derived class or child class.

```cpp

class Vehicle {
    public:
        string brand;
        string model;
        int year;
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
    public:
        int price;
};

Car myCar;

myCar.brand = "Ford";

myCar.price = 50000;

```

### Protected Access Modifier

The `protected` access modifier is similar to the `private` access modifier, but the members declared as `protected` can be accessed by the derived classes.

```cpp

class Vehicle {
    protected:
        string brand;
        string model;
        int year;
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
    public:
        int price;
};

Car myCar;

myCar.brand = "Ford"; // Error: 'std::string Vehicle::brand' is protected within this context

```

## Methods Overriding

Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

```cpp

class Vehicle {
    public:
        virtual void display() {
            cout << "Vehicle" << endl;
        }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
    public:
        void display() override {
            cout << "Car" << endl;
        }
};


Car myCar;

myCar.display(); // Output: Car

```

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In C++, polymorphism is achieved through virtual functions and function overriding.

```cpp

class Animal {
    public:
        virtual void makeSound() {
            cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl;
        }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
    public:
        void makeSound() override {
            cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
        }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
    public:
        void makeSound() override {
            cout << "Cat meows" << endl;
        }
};

Animal* animal = new Dog();

animal->makeSound(); // Output: Dog barks

animal = new Cat();

animal->makeSound(); // Output: Cat meows

```

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class from the outside world.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency by providing a simplified interface.

```cpp

class Shape {
    public:
        virtual void draw() = 0;
};

class Circle : public Shape {
    public:
        void draw() override {
            cout << "Drawing a circle" << endl;
        }
};


class Rectangle : public Shape {
    public:
        void draw() override {
            cout << "Drawing a rectangle" << endl;
        }
};

Shape* shape = new Circle();

shape->draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle

shape = new Rectangle();

shape->draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle

```

## Interfaces

An interface is a class that contains only pure virtual functions. It is used to define a contract that must be implemented by the classes that inherit from it.

### Pure Virtual Functions

A pure virtual function is a virtual function that has no implementation in the base class and must be implemented by the derived classes.

## Abstract Classes VS Interfaces

Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in C++. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain one or more pure virtual functions. An interface is a class that contains only pure virtual functions.

```cpp

class Shape {
    public:
        virtual void draw() = 0;
};

class Circle : public Shape {
    public:
        void draw() override {
            cout << "Drawing a circle" << endl;
        }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
    public:
        void draw() override {
            cout << "Drawing a rectangle" << endl;
        }
};

Shape* shape = new Circle();

shape->draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle

shape = new Rectangle();


```
