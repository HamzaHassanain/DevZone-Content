## Why Loops?

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are useful when you need to perform a task multiple times. For example, you can use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10, or to calculate the sum of the first 100 numbers.

## While Loops

A `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as the condition is true. The syntax of a `while` loop is as follows:

```cpp

while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}

```

Here is an example of a `while` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```cpp

int i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
    cout << i << endl;
    i++;
}

```

In the above code, the loop will continue to run as long as the value of `i` is less than or equal to 5. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

## For Loops

A `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. The syntax of a `for` loop is as follows:

```cpp

for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}

```

Here is an example of a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    cout << i << endl;
}

```

## Nested Loops

### For Loop inside a For Loop

You can put a `for` loop inside another `for` loop. This is called a nested loop. Here is an example of a nested loop that prints a rectangle of stars:

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

```

### While Loop inside a For Loop

You can also put a `while` loop inside a `for` loop. Here is an example of a `while` loop inside a `for` loop:

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    int j = 1;
    while (j <= 5) {
        cout << "*";
        j++;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

```

### For Loop inside a While Loop

You can also put a `for` loop inside a `while` loop. Here is an example of a `for` loop inside a `while` loop:

```cpp

int i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << endl;
    i++;
}

```

## Scopes With Loops

A scope is a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`. When you declare a variable inside a loop, the variable is only accessible within that loop. Here is an example:

```cpp

int i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
    int x = 10;
    cout << x << endl; // 10
    i++;
}

cout << x << endl; // Error: x is not accessible here

```

In the above code, the variable `x` is declared inside the `while` loop, so it is only accessible within the loop.

When using for loops, the variable declared in the initialization part of the loop is only accessible within the loop, and will not be accessible outside the loop. For example:

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    int x = 10;
    cout << x << endl; // 10
}

cout << i << endl; // Error: i is not accessible here

```

When using nested loops, the inner loop can access variables declared in the outer loop. For example:

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    int x = 10;
    cout << x << endl; // 10

    for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
        cout << x << endl; // 10
        cout << i << endl; // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    }

    cout << j << endl; // Error: j is not accessible here
}

```

## Loop Control Statements

### Break

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop before it has completed all its iterations. When the `break` statement is encountered, the loop is terminated immediately, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop. Here is an example of using the `break` statement in a `for` loop:

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break;
    }
    cout << i << endl;
}

```

In the above code, the loop will print numbers from 1 to 4, and then exit when `i` is equal to 5.

### Continue

The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. When the `continue` statement is encountered, the loop will skip the remaining code in the current iteration and continue with the next iteration. Here is an example of using the `continue` statement in a `for` loop:

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    cout << i << endl;
}

```

### Nested Loops with Break and Continue

You can use `break` and `continue` statements in nested loops. Here is an example of using `break` and `continue` in nested loops:

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
        if (j == 3) {
            break;
        }
        cout << i << " " << j << endl;
    }
}
```

## Infinite Loops

An infinite loop is a loop that never terminates. This can happen if the loop condition is always true, or if there is no condition specified in the loop. Here is an example of an infinite loop:

```cpp

while (true) {
    cout << "This is an infinite loop" << endl;
}

for(int i = 1; i > 0; i++) {
    cout << "This is an infinite loop" << endl;
}


```
