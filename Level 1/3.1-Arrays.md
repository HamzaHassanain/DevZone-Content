## What is an array?

An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element in an array is accessed by an index, which is an integer value that represents the position of the element in the array.

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They are useful when you need to work with a collection of values that are related to each other.

## Why do we need arrays?

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They are useful when you need to work with a collection of values that are related to each other.

For example, you can use an array to store the scores of students in a class, the temperatures recorded over a period of time, or the names of employees in a company.

## Declaring an array

To declare an array in C++, you need to specify the type of the elements in the array and the size of the array. The syntax for declaring an array is as follows:

```cpp

type name[size];

```

Here is an example of declaring an array of integers with 5 elements:

```cpp

int numbers[5];

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` that can store 5 integers.

## Accessing elements of an array

You can access elements of an array using the index of the element. The index of an array starts from 0, so the first element of an array has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.

Here is an example of accessing elements of an array:

```cpp

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

cout << numbers[0] << endl; // 10

cout << numbers[1] << endl; // 20

cout << numbers[2] << endl; // 30

cout << numbers[3] << endl; // 40

cout << numbers[4] << endl; // 50

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and initialized it with some values. We have then accessed each element of the array using its index.

## Initializing an array

You can initialize an array when you declare it by providing a list of values enclosed in curly braces `{}`. The

number of values in the list should be equal to the size of the array.

Here is an example of initializing an array:

```cpp

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and initialized it with the values 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.

If you do not provide an initial value for an element of the array, the element will be initialized to some garbage value.

Here is an example of declaring an array without initializing it:

```cpp

int numbers[5];

cout << numbers[0] << endl; // Garbage value

```

To get rid of the garbage value, you can initialize the array with zeros:

```cpp

int numbers[5] = {0};

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and initialized it with zeros.

## Array operations

### Taking Array Input

You can take input for an array by using a loop to read values from the user and store them in the array.

Here is an example of taking input for an array:

```cpp

int numbers[5];

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    cin >> numbers[i];

}

```

For Generalized Input:

```cpp

int n;
cin >> n;

int numbers[n];

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

    cin >> numbers[i];

}

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and used a `for` loop to read values from the user and store them in the array.

### Finding the length of an array

You can find the length of an array by dividing the total size of the array by the size of one element in the array. The total size of the array can be calculated by using the `sizeof` operator.

Here is an example of finding the length of an array:

```cpp

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

int length = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);

cout << length << endl; // 5

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and calculated the length of the array by dividing the total size of the array by the size of one element in the array.

### Iterating over an array

You can iterate over an array using a loop to access each element of the array. You can use a `for` loop or a `while` loop to iterate over the elements of an array.

Here is an example of iterating over an array using a `for` loop:

```cpp

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    cout << numbers[i] << endl;

}

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and used a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the array and print them.

### Copying an array

You can copy the elements of one array to another array by iterating over the elements of the source array and assigning them to the destination array.

Here is an example of copying an array:

```cpp

int source[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

int destination[5];

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    destination[i] = source[i];

}

```

In the above code, we have declared two arrays named `source` and `destination` with 5 elements each. We have then used a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the `source` array and copy them to the `destination` array.

### Sorting an array

You can sort the elements of an array in ascending or descending order using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header.

Here is an example of sorting an array in ascending order:

```cpp

int numbers[5] = {50, 30, 40, 10, 20};

sort(numbers, numbers + 5);

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and used the `sort` function to sort the elements of the array in ascending order.

### Reversing an array

You can reverse the elements of an array by swapping the elements at the beginning and end of the array, and then moving towards the center of the array.

Here is an example of reversing an array:

```cpp

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

int start = 0;

int end = 4;

while (start < end) {

    int temp = numbers[start];

    numbers[start] = numbers[end];

    numbers[end] = temp;

    start++;

    end--;

}

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and used a `while` loop to reverse the elements of the array.

### Searching an array

You can search for an element in an array by iterating over the elements of the array and comparing each element with the element you are searching for.

Here is an example of searching for an element in an array:

```cpp

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

int target = 30;

bool found = false;

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    if (numbers[i] == target) {

        found = true;

        break;

    }

}

if (found) {

    cout << "Element found" << endl;

} else {

    cout << "Element not found" << endl;

}

```

In the above code, we have declared an array named `numbers` with 5 elements and searched for the element `30` in the array. We have used a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the array and compare each element with the target element.

## Multidimensional arrays

A multidimensional array is an array of arrays. It is used to store data in multiple dimensions, such as rows and columns.

You can declare a multidimensional array by specifying the number of rows and columns in the array.

Here is an example of declaring a 2D array:

```cpp

int matrix[3][3];

```

In the above code, we have declared a 2D array named `matrix` with 3 rows and 3 columns.

You can access elements of a multidimensional array using two indices, one for the row and one for the column.

Here is an example of accessing elements of a 2D array:

```cpp

int matrix[3][3];

for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

    for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

        matrix[i][j] = i * 3 + j + 1;

    }

}

cout << matrix[0][0] << endl; // 1

cout << matrix[1][1] << endl; // 5

cout << matrix[2][2] << endl; // 9

```

In the above code, we have declared a 2D array named `matrix` with 3 rows and 3 columns and initialized it with some values. We have then accessed each element of the array using two indices, one for the row and one for the column.

You can also declare a multidimensional array with more than two dimensions by specifying the number of dimensions in the array.

Here is an example of declaring a 3D array:

```cpp

int cube[3][3][3];

```

In the above code, we have declared a 3D array named `cube` with 3 dimensions.

You can access elements of a multidimensional array with more than two dimensions by using multiple indices.

Here is an example of accessing elements of a 3D array:

```cpp

int cube[3][3][3];

for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

    for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

        for(int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {

            cube[i][j][k] = i + j + k;

        }

    }

}


cout << cube[0][0][0] << endl; // 0
```
