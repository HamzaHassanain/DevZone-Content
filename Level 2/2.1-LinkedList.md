## What is Linked List?

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to `null`. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a `null` reference.

## Types of Linked List

There are three common types of Linked List.

1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains only one pointer to the next node. This is what we have been discussing so far.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains two pointers, a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node.
3. **Circular Linked List**: Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no `null` at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.

## Advantages of Linked List

1. **Dynamic Data Structure**: Linked list is a dynamic data structure so it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory. So there is no need to give initial size of linked list.

2. **Insertion and Deletion**: Insertion and deletion of nodes are really easier. Unlike array here we donâ€™t have to shift elements after insertion or deletion of an element. In linked list we just have to update the address present in next pointer of a node.

3. **No Memory Wastage**: In linked list, memory is allocated only if we add a new element. In an array, memory is pre-allocated for all elements whether they are used or not.

4. **Implementation**: Data structures like stack and queues can be easily implemented using linked list.

## Disadvantages of Linked List

1. **Memory Usage**: More memory is required for storing elements in linked list as compared to array. Because in linked list each node contains a pointer and an element.

2. **Traversal**: Elements or nodes traversal is difficult in linked list. We can not randomly access the elements in a linked list. Elements should be accessed sequentially starting from the first node. In an array, elements can be randomly accessed using the index.

3. **Reverse Traversing**: Singly linked list can be traversed only in one direction. The reverse traversing is not possible in singly linked list.

## Basic Implementation of Linked List

### Node Class

```cpp

class Node {

public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int data) {
        this->data = data;
        this->next = nullptr;
    }
};

```

### LinkedList Class

```cpp

class LinkedList {

public:
    Node* head;
    LinkedList() {
        this->head = nullptr;
    }

    void insert(int val) {}
    void remove(int val) {}
    void traverse() {}
    Node* search(int val) {}

};

```

## Basic Operations on Linked List

### Insertion

Insertion is the process of adding a new node to the linked list. We can add the new node at the beginning, at the end or in the middle of the linked list.

1. **Insertion at the beginning**
2. **Insertion at the end**
3. **Insertion in the middle**

```cpp

void insert(int val) {

    Node* newNode = new Node(val);

    if (head == nullptr) {
        head = newNode;
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp->next != nullptr) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    temp->next = newNode;
}

void insert(int val, int position) {

    Node* newNode = new Node(val);

    if (head == nullptr) {
        head = newNode;
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < position - 1; i++) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    newNode->next = temp->next;
    temp->next = newNode;
}

void insert_at_the_end(int val) {

    Node* newNode = new Node(val);

    if (head == nullptr) {
        head = newNode;
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp->next != nullptr) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    temp->next = newNode;
}

```

### Deletion

Deletion is the process of removing a node from the linked list. We can delete a node from the beginning, from the end or from the middle of the linked list.

1. **Deletion from the beginning**
2. **Deletion from the end**
3. **Deletion With A Specific Value**
4. **Deletion With a Specific Node**

```cpp


void remove_from_beginning() {

    if (head == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    head = head->next;
    delete temp;
}

void remove_from_end() {

    if (head == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    Node* prev = nullptr;
    while (temp->next != nullptr) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    prev->next = nullptr;
    delete temp;
}

void remove(int val) {

    if (head == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    Node* prev = nullptr;
    while (temp != nullptr && temp->data != val) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    if (temp == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    prev->next = temp->next;
    delete temp;
}


void remove(Node* node) {
    // delete the current node from the list

    if (node == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = node->next;
    node->data = temp->data;
    node->next = temp->next;
    delete temp;
}

```

### Traversal

Traversal is the process of visiting each node in the linked list exactly once. We can traverse the linked list from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning.

```cpp

void traverse() {

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr) {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

```

### Search

Search is the process of finding a node with a specific value in the linked list.

```cpp

Node* search(int val) {

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr && temp->data != val) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    return temp;
}

```

## Applications of Linked List

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

Linked list allocates the memory dynamically. So it is easy to allocate memory at runtime. For example, when we use a linked list to implement a stack, we can push elements into the stack without worrying about the size of the stack.

### Implementing other data structures

Linked list can be used to implement other data structures like stack, queue, graph, etc.
