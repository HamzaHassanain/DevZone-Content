## Basic Binary Search

Binary search is an algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements based on the comparison. The process is repeated until the target value is found or the remaining elements are empty.

The following code demonstrates a basic binary search algorithm that finds the position of a target value in a sorted array:

```cpp

int binary_search(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.size() - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

```

You do not have to have an array to perform binary search.

Imagine this,

Find the number positive number N such that, the sum of numbers from 1 to N is K (Assume There is always a solution)

```cpp

long long l = 1, r = K;

while(l <= r) {
    long long mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
    long long sum = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
    if(sum == K) {
        return mid;
    } else if(sum < K) {
        l = mid + 1;
    } else {
        r = mid - 1;
    }
}

```

## Lower Bound and Upper Bound

### Lower Bound

The lower bound of a value in a sorted array is the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the target value. If the target value is greater than all elements in the array, the lower bound is the index of the first element after the last element.

```cpp

int lower_bound(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.size()-1;

    int ans =-1;

    while(left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if(arr[mid] >= target) {
            ans = mid;
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return ans;

}

```

You can also, use the `std::lower_bound` function from the C++ STL to find the lower bound of a value in a sorted array.

```cpp

int lb(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    auto it = lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), target);
    return it - arr.begin();
}

```

### Upper Bound

The upper bound of a value in a sorted array is the index of the first element that is greater than the target value. If the target value is greater than or equal to all elements in the array, the upper bound is the index of the first element after the last element.

```cpp

int upper_bound(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.size()-1;

    int ans =-1;

    while(left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if(arr[mid] > target) {
            ans = mid;
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return ans;

}

```

You can also, use the `std::upper_bound` function from the C++ STL to find the upper bound of a value in a sorted array.

```cpp

int ub(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    auto it = upper_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), target);
    return it - arr.begin();
}

```

## Binary Search on Floating Point Numbers

Binary search can also be used to find the square root of a number or to solve problems involving floating-point numbers. The following code demonstrates a binary search algorithm that finds the square root of a number with a specified precision:

```cpp


double binary_search(double target, double precision) {
    double left = 0;
    double right = target;

    while (right - left > precision) {
        double mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (mid * mid < target) {
            left = mid;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    return left + (right - left) / 2;
}

```

Above Code may have some problems and Precision is not guaranteed. But, it is a good starting point.

One of the safer ways, and more accurate, is to run the binary search for a fixed number of iterations, and then return the value.

```cpp


double find_sqrt(double target, int iterations) {
    double left = 0;
    double right = target;
    double ans = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
        double mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if(mid * mid < target) { // If mid is less than the square root
            left = mid;
            ans = mid;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    return ans;
}

```
