## What is Two Pointers?

Two pointers is a technique that uses two pointers to solve problems that can be solved by iterating through the array with two pointers. The two pointers can be in the same direction or in opposite directions.

## Sliding Window

Sliding window is a technique that uses two pointers to solve problems that can be solved by iterating through the array with two pointers. The two pointers can be in the same direction or in opposite directions.

Here is a template for the sliding window technique:

```cpp

int left = 0, right = 0;

while(right < n) {

    while(right < n && condition) {
        // Do something
        right++;
    }

    // while(left < right && condition) {
    //     // Do something
    //     left++;
    // }
    // Do something
    left++;
}

```

Other Template:

```cpp

int left = 0, right = 0;

while (right < n) {
    // Do something
    right++;
    // Update left pointer
    while (left < right && condition) {
        // Do something
        left++;
    }
}

```

## Problems

### Merge Sorted Array

[Link](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/1/practice/contest/307092/problem/A)

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

```cpp

int n, m;
cin >> n >> m;

vector<int> A(n), B(m);

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
}

for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> B[i];
}


vector<int> C(n + m);

int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

while (i < n && j < m) {
    if (A[i] < B[j]) {
        C[k++] = A[i++];
    } else {
        C[k++] = B[j++];
    }
}

while (i < n) {
    C[k++] = A[i++];
}

while (j < m) {
    C[k++] = B[j++];
}

for (int i = 0; i < n + m; i++) {
    cout << C[i] << " ";
}



```

### Number of Smaller

[Link](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/1/practice/contest/307092/problem/B)

You are given two arrays, sorted in non-decreasing order. For each element of the second array, find the number of elements in the first array strictly less than it.

```cpp

int n, m;

cin >> n >> m;

vector<int> A(n), B(m);

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> A[i];
}

for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    cin >> B[i];
}

int i = 0, j = 0;

while (j < m) {
    while (i < n && A[i] < B[j]) {
        i++;
    }
    cout << i << " ";
    j++;
}

```

### Segment With Smallest Sum

[Link](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/2/practice/contest/307093/problem/A)

Given an array of n integers a[i]. Let's say that the segment of this array a[l..r] (1≤l≤r≤n) is good if the sum of elements on this segment is at most s. Find the longest good segment.

```cpp

int n, s;

cin >> n >> s;

vector<int> a(n);

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
}

int i = 0, j = 0, sum = 0, ans = 0;

while (j < n) {
    sum += a[j];
    while (sum > s) {
        sum -= a[i];
        i++;
    }
    ans = max(ans, j - i + 1);
    j++;
}
```

### Number of Segments with Smallest Sum

[Link](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/2/practice/contest/307093/problem/C)

Given an array of n integers a[i]. Let's say that the segment of this array a[l..r] (1≤l≤r≤n) is good if the sum of elements on this segment is at most s. Find the number of good segments.

```cpp

int n, s;

cin >> n >> s;

vector<int> a(n);

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
}

int i = 0, j = 0, sum = 0, ans = 0;

while (j < n) {
    sum += a[j];
    while (sum > s) {
        sum -= a[i];
        i++;
    }
    ans += j - i + 1;
    j++;
}

```

### Segments with Small Set

[Link](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/2/practice/contest/307093/problem/E)

Given an array of n integers a[i]. Let's say that the segment of this array a[l..r] (1≤l≤r≤n) is good if the number of distinct elements on this segment is at most k. Find the number of good segments.

```cpp

int n, k;

cin >> n >> k;

vector<int> a(n);

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
}

int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0;

map<int, int> m;

while (j < n) {
    m[a[j]]++;
    while (m.size() > k) {
        m[a[i]]--;
        if (m[a[i]] == 0) {
            m.erase(a[i]);
        }
        i++;
    }
    ans += j - i + 1;
    j++;
}

```

### Segment With Smallest Spread

[Link](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/9/2/practice/contest/307093/problem/F)

Given an array of n integers a[i]. Let's say that a segment of this array a[l..r] (1≤l≤r≤n) is good if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements on this segment is at most k. Your task is to find the number of different good segments.

```cpp

int n, k;

cin >> n >> k;

vector<int> a(n);

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
}

int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0;

multiset<int> s;

while (j < n) {
    s.insert(a[j]);
    while (*s.rbegin() - *s.begin() > k) {
        s.erase(s.find(a[i]));
        i++;
    }
    ans += j - i + 1;
    j++;
}

```
